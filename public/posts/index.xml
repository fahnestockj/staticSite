      <description>The goal of this post is to unpack Cheng Lou&amp;rsquo;s On the Spectrum of Abstraction Talk given at React-Europe in 2016.
The more I learn about the various competing javascript tools like frameworks, libraries, etc the more confused I am by how there isn&amp;rsquo;t a set guide on if you want A use B. As a beginner most tools are entirely unclear on what their purpose is and why/how they help.</description>

      <description>What is it Mutability in Javascript refers to the ability to change the state of an object after its creation.
 In Javascript some examples of immutable objects are language primitives. As the lowest atomic level of the language, primitives are immutable which allows easy comparison between values.
For example string primitives cannot be modified after they&amp;rsquo;re created.
const string1 = &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39; string1.concat(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) console.log(string1) //foo string1 is not actually modified by its method, instead it the method returns a new string with the concatenation complete.</description>
