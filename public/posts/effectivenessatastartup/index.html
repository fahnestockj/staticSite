This independence is super freeing especially when coming from a university environment (where very often you‚Äôre constrained into solving problems one way) but it comes with a different kind of stress.

Startups need to cultivate pride/appreciation for iteration since it doesn‚Äôt come naturally. Company culture at a startup controls a lot of how employees see their work.\nSometimes the uncertainty of an ill-defined/murky problem can be frustrating. I‚Äôve planned some solutions that didn‚Äôt fully understand the depth of the problem they were trying to solve. A couple have rabbit holed down into these very complex domain concepts that I didn‚Äôt have a grasp on before trying to make solution.\nMy natural response to these situations is some anger and frustration since there‚Äôs a feeling of failure in the solution I‚Äôve dedicated hours of work towards.
