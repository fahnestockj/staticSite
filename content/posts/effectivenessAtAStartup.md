I've been working at Quanta Technologies a small scrappy startup for the last 8 months. The team has varied from 3-5 members meaning I've gotten to know my coworkers very well, and am intimately close with the software we're building.

Quanta's values are to be resourceful, iterative, and results driven which to me have always wrapped up into the word **effective**. How can we really get the most out of our time.

## ~Premature Optimization~
Unfortunately money exists and time passes. A project needs a deadline otherwise it will get lost in trying to fix problems before they've happened. Good solutions to problems are expensive, they take time and thoughtfulness. As an intern I often am trying to solve problems that are murky or ill-defined. Either I don't have much experience with what I'm working on or our team hasn't found the time to fully plan out next steps or both at the same time! This uncertainty is part of startup life, and properly managing it is most of the job.

Working at a startup has come with a lot of independence where I now hold the responsibility of what I should be currently be working on. This independence is super freeing especially when coming from a university environment (where very often you're constrained into solving problems one way) but it comes with a different kind of stress. I can now be worried of if what I'm currently doing is **effective**. Am I wasting time on a good solution for something might never be a problem?

When planning starts to break down the stress compounds, and it's important to hold onto what it means to work iteratively. Under time pressure perfect is always overkill. Iteration isn't comfortable, it's incomplete. A startup team needs to be able to appreciate and be proud of incomplete work. This doesn't mean we should lower our standards or do less work, it means we need to **fail quickly**.

## Appreciating Incomplete Work
Turns out emotions impact behavior and sometimes feeling like you're constantly failing can be bad for morale ðŸ˜®. Startups need to cultivate pride/appreciation for iteration since it doesn't come naturally. Company culture at a startup controls a lot of how employees see their work.

Sometimes the uncertainty of an ill-defined/murky problem can be frustrating. I've planned some solutions that didn't fully understand the depth of the problem they were trying to solve. A couple have rabbit holed down into these very complex domain concepts that I didn't have a grasp on before trying to make solution. 

My natural response to these situations is some anger and frustration since there's a feeling of failure in the solution I've dedicated hours of work towards. I want to be able to predict these things ahead of time, and fully understand the problem before making the solution. Reality is iteration is the most **effective** path forward and it naturally guides you towards the important problems that need to be solved.

Quanta cultivates appreciation for iteration in meetings called Retros (Agile Retrospectives) where the whole team talks through what has gone right and wrong, and what can be done to change the way we work in the future. At Quanta we have our biggest breakthroughs at Retros mostly because we connect the emotional side of our work with the results of our work. As a team we recognize the frustrations of iterating, of ill-defined/murky problems, and frame what solutions we need to dedicate our time to.
