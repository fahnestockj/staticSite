Used assembly programming to create a 16 bit binary to decimal converter which gathers inputs using processor interrupts and displays on a 16x2 character LCD. Design came from [Ben Eater's](https://eater.net/) fantastic series on building and programming a 6502.

Gained experience breadboarding and debugging circuits including making a debounced single step clock to debug the early stages of the 6502.
