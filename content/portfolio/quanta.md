As a founding engineer at Quanta Markets, I've spent the past few years building a modern SaaS platform that simplifies hedge management for oil and gas companies. Quanta replaces expensive, consultant-led workflows with self-serve software tailored to the needs of E&P finance teams. It automates deal tracking, mark-to-market valuations, discrepancy resolution, and report generation.

I led the product loop from start to finish by conducting user interviews with CFOs, accountants, and capital providers, shaping a focused and high-impact roadmap, and building full-stack systems that drive both retention and revenue. These efforts helped increase our user retention rate by 20 percentage points (66% -> 86%),  and positioned Quanta as a compelling alternative to six-figure consulting contracts.

On the engineering side, I redesigned ingestion and cashflow systems to be idempotent and failure-resistant, which reduced data sync issues by 90 percent. I also led a database schema refactor to resolve data integrity failures and double query performance, ensuring accurate and reliable financial reporting for our users. The product now delivers everything from settlement reports to cashflow projections with just a few clicks, with 24/7 availability and minimal manual effort.

Quanta is now trusted by energy finance professionals across the U.S., showing that enterprise-grade hedging tools can be both accessible and cost-effective.
